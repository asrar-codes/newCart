# newCart
a site where you can add items to the cart, increase amount of each item, remove elements from the cart (data stored in localStorage)

when clearing the cart, I just used a short cut where I cleared the LocalStorage and reloaded the page.. I could've done it in the long route but like it this way since 
in the upcoming day i would rather use a database to store all of the data.

Other than that if you've any suggestion write to [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/AsrarCodes)
